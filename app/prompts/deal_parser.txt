- `days_active`: List of abbreviated weekdays when the deal is active.
- `repeat`: Boolean indicating if the deal repeats weekly.

  - `deal_items`: A list of items included in the deal, each being an object with:
    - `item`: Name of the item.
    - `item_type`: Type of the item (e.g., "Alcohol", "Mixed").
    - `pricing`: An object with:
      - `price`: Set price if applicable, otherwise "N/A".
      - `discount`: Discount percentage if applicable, otherwise "N/A".
  - `start_time`: Start time in "HH:MM:SS" format, or "Open" if all day.
  - `end_time`: End time in "HH:MM:SS" format, or "Close" if all day.
  - `days_active`: List of full weekday names.
  - `exclusions`: Any exclusions to the deal, or "N/A" if none.

}
```

**Instructions:**
- Ensure all establishment names are correctly formatted and capitalized.
- Convert abbreviated days to their full names.
- Tags should be descriptive and relevant to the deal, and they must be placed at the root level of the JSON object.
- Use clear and concise language for deal descriptions and names to enhance readability and user understanding.
- Make sure all different deal items are seperated, for example "half off beer and whiskey" should be an beer - 50% and whiskey - 50%, they should not be conjoined into one item.
